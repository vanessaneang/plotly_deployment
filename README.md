# plotly_deployment

## Overview
In this project plotly and javascript was used to create a working webpage that demonstrates the various bacterial strains found in participants' bellybuttons. This functional site is able to filter through the json data and generate three different graphs. The first graph is a barchart that shows the top ten bacterial strains found in the participant's bellybutton. Next is a washing frequency gauge that shows how often the participant washes their bellybutton. Last is a bubble chart that shows all bacterial strains found and shows the frequency of each strain by varying diameters sizes of the markers.

## Challenges
Difficulties I had in this project was chianing multiple functions together and finding the correct syntax in order to do so. It was a bit confusing, but I was able to get the code to run well and have a fully functioning webpage. Also setting up the github pages took me a little while to figure out, but once I was able to create the github.io in my username it was quite easy afterwards. I'm very proud of the progress made so far and will think about using github pages to possibly make a work in progress portfolio in the future since it is nice to have the interactive functions for the different graphs.
